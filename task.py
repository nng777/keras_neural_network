TASK
Make the following three changes to app.py:
1.Add a Layer: Add a second Dense hidden layer to the model. It should have 8 neurons and use the relu activation function. Place it between the existing hidden layer and the output layer.
2.Change the Optimizer: In the model.compile() step, change the optimizer from 'adam' to 'sgd' (Stochastic Gradient Descent).
3.Increase Training Time: In the model.fit() step, increase the number of epochs from 50 to 100."""
